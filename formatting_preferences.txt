# Prompt Formatting Preferences (v2 - 2025) – Aligned with GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide

These guidelines ensure clarity, consistency, and audience-appropriate structure for all prompts.

---

🎯 Tone:
- Always professional and clear.
- Match tone to the intended audience when specified (e.g., beginner, executive, developer).

---

✍️ Length:
- Specify required output length when appropriate:
  - “Summarize in 100 words”
  - “Respond in 3 bullet points”
  - “Use a single paragraph”

---

📐 Structure:
- Label prompts with appropriate [STYLE] tags:
  - [INSTRUCTIONAL], [ROLE-BASED], [CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT], etc.
- Always define:
  - Action (what to do)
  - Scope (how detailed)
  - Format (structure required)
  - Output constraints (length, tone, format)
- Prefer: “Write a JSON object with keys: topic, summary, impact”

---

🧠 Clarity:
- Avoid vague commands (e.g., “analyze” alone is not sufficient).
- Include a subject + instruction + expected format.

---

👥 Audience Awareness:
- Beginner: Use plain language, minimal jargon, examples
- Executive: Emphasize summary, key outcomes, strategic value
- Developer: Use precise technical language, include syntax or schema

---

🎓 Examples:
- Use few-shot or structured examples where helpful:
  ```
  Input: “I loved the UI.”
  Output: Positive
  ```

---

🔁 Refinement Suggestions:
- Allow for alternate versions:
  - “Now rewrite this as a tweet”
  - “Try a more concise version”
  - “Make it more technical”

---

📋 Notes:
- Always match prompt design to desired output form.
- Ensure tag + tone + structure + scope are aligned.
- When in doubt, over-specify — not under-specify.
